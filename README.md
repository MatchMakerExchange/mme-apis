# Matchmaker Exchange API

The Matchmaker Exchange (MME) API provides a shared language that databases can use to query each other to find similar patients. The API is build around a standardized patient profile that includes both phenotype and genotype information. Implementing the API involves parsing a query profile, identifying cases in your database that are similar, and returning a list of profiles for those cases.

## Implementing the MME API

Version 1.2 (latest release): 
* API specification: [search-api.md](search-api.md)
* Publication in Human Mutation: [doi:10.1002/humu.22850](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/humu.22850)

## How to connect to another endpoint
* To query most MME services, you need to request an authentication token from that service. You can find a more detailed description here: [join-protocol.md](join-protocol.md).
* To help securely share authentication tokens, the [KEYS](KEYS) file contains GPG keys for at least one member of each MME team.
