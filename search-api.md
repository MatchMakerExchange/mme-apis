# OVERVIEW

**Submit patient matching request:**
`HTTP POST` to remote server: `<base_remote_url>/match`
For example: `https://yourmatchmaker.org/match`


## Versioning

Every request must specify the API version within the HTTP `Accept` header.

`Accept: application/vnd.ga4gh.matchmaker.<version>+json`

Where `<version>` takes the form `vX.Y`. For example:

`Accept: application/vnd.ga4gh.matchmaker.v0.1+json`

The remote server must provide the API version of the response in the `Content-Type` header of every response:

`Content-Type: application/vnd.ga4gh.matchmaker.v0.7+json`

After receiving a request, the remote server can respond in one of two ways:
  * If a compatible version (`vX.Z` where `Z>=Y`) is supported by the remote server, it should provide a response using this version.
  * If no appropriate version is supported by the remote server, it should respond with `Not Acceptable (406)`, containing a JSON body with a description of the error. The response should contain a `Content-Type` header with the latest API version supported by the server. This will enable the user to re-submit the request using this version of the API.


## Search Request

`HTTP POST` request to `<base_remote_url>/match`, with an `application/json` body with the following format:

## Search Results Response
A synchronous `application/json` response, of the following form:

### Example

```
{
  "results" : [
    {
	  "score" : {
        "patient" : <number>
      },
      "patient" : {…},
    },
    …
  ]
}
```

#### Results
* ***Mandatory***, but can be empty.
* Is a **list of matches**, where each match has a `patient` object, and a `score` object with information about how well the `patient` object matched.

##### Score
* ***Mandatory***
* Information about how well this results patient matched the query patient.
* Currently, this has a single ***mandatory*** field, `patient`, with a numerical value corresponding to the overall score of the match. This score must be in the range [0, 1], where 0.0 is a poor match and 1.0 is a perfect match.

##### Patient
* ***Mandatory***
* A `patient` object of the same form as the one described above for the query.

### Error handling
The remote server should use HTTP status codes to report any errors encountered processing the match request. Here are a list of status codes and their meanings with regards to this API:

| HTTP Status Code | Reason Phrase | Description
| ---------------- | -------- | -----------
| 200 | OK | no error |
| 400 | Bad Request | missing/invalid data
| 401 | Unauthorized | invalid API key
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | invalid method (GET)
| 406 | Not Acceptable | unsupported API version
| 415 | Unsupported Media Type | missing/invalid content type
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | missing/invalid request body
| 500 | Internal Server Error | default error

The error response should include a json-formatted body with a human-readable `"message"` containing further details about the error. The exact error message is up to the implementer, and additional fields can be provided with further information. For example, if the match request specifies an unsupported API version, the server should respond with `Not Acceptable (406)` and a content body such as:

```
{
  "message" : "unsupported API version",
  "supportedVersions" : [ "0.1", "1.0", "1.1" ]
}
```

### Testing
Matchmakers are strongly encouraged to test the ability of their systems to query, match, and respond to requests. Standardized test data is provided to simplify this process. There are several ways to test the API:
  * Internal queries: One option is to send the request to your own system and verify that the query and response are formatted correctly and the match is accurate.
  * External queries: A second option is to query another matchmaker with [test data](testing/). In these cases, an additional property of the `"patient"` object should be specified: `"test" : true`. This informs the system being queried that the query is a test, allowing it to respond according. Specifically, the system being queried should suppress any automatic email notifications and include test data in the response (if it is normally hidden).
